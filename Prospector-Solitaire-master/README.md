# Prospector-Solitaire
Here is the repository for the Prospector Solitaire Prototype from page 640 of "Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping and Development", by Jeremy Gibson Bond, Second Edition..

This implementation is broken, but has Text, not GUI Text and has Pips if you manually remove the back of the card.

Completed in Unity 2017.3.1f1
